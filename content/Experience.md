### Intel Nonvolatile Memory Storage Group

#### Folsom CA | June 2019 - August 2019

#### Software Developer Intern	

I was a part of Intel's NSG Tool Development Group. 
My main task was to develop a Python script to parse through various XML formats related to different NSG products, automating the extraction and analysis of critical information.
When I was not working on that project, I created and maintained tables in a database using SQL to support efficient data organization and retrieval. 
All in all, I engaged in continuous learning to stay abreast of industry best practices and emerging technologies, applying acquired knowledge to enhance tool development processes. 

### SFApex

#### Houston TX | June 2018 - August 2018	

#### Software Developer Intern	

As an aspiring computer scientest, I worked with a development team that worked on a Salesforce App specialized in data migration between sandboxes. 
I worked with MVC design practices to create and implement a Data Compare feature for in NodeJS. 
I drew data from Dbeaver SQL servers to run through a JavaScript comparison algorithm. 
Furthermore, I established data validation for the data incoming from the databases using JavaScript's JOI library.
