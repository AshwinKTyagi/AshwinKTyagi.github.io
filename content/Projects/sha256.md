## SHA-256 Encoder Objective:

The SHA-256 Algorithm aims to provide a integrous way of transferring data from one person to another.
Rather than security, it is more important to prevent changes in transit from a malicious 3rd party. Our goal in this 

 
Divide into blocks of 512 bits with final block padded by {100â€¦0, length of the message}
Process blocks individually
Block undergoes word expansion 
Letters are then translated according to predetermined hash values
